          --help <u>someone</u>

          --play <u>something</u>
                   plays something. SOMETHING can, and should be, a sport, video or board 
                   game; if SOMETHING: musical instrument, beware of noise-induced 
                   hearing loss
     
          --work
                   prints professional experience, may also `do` work if the time is right...
     
          --yum

                   datetime parse
     
     <B>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</B>
          Over 10 years of experience in information technology and computer security;
          currently an offensive security tester and automation engineer at Mastercard.
     
          Holds a bachelor's degree from Florida International University in Information 
          Technology (2010) and a graduate certificate in Cybersecurity Management from 
          Washington University in St. Louis (2021). Is OSCP, GWAPT, GCIH and CISSP certified. 
     
          Passionate about almost every aspect of technology; was a system administrator
          and ticket-slayer in past lives. Loves Python and can build cool stuff with it.
     
          The --work option will do work-like things, sometimes unpredictable. 
          Mow the lawn? OK. Write an automated vulnerability scanner? Sure. 
          Also note: at certain times you can pipe the output of the --work option 
          to a problematic server and it'll make its problems go away:
     
                $ martin-enriquez --work | nc host.example.com 22
                SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1
                Protocol mismatch...
                Just kidding!
                PROBLEMS SOLVED!
     
     <B>ETHICAL HACKING</B>
          Figuring ways to defeat a security implementation is this nerd's raison
          d'etre.
     
          Always with good intentions in mind, and with the objective to help
          increase the security of the target under attack, the --hack option 
          is an evolution of the --debug option.
     
          There is no magic sauce or super secret skill behind hacking. 
          This nerd takes his time to break down and oversimplify a process,
          and then finds ways to abuse or misuse such process. 
     
          The definition of `process` is not limited to computer processes or
          network-connected computers but also human processes.
     
          A BIG admirer of the folks who are better than. Always gets
          excited to learn something new.
     
     <B>WHEN HUNGER CALLS</B>
          The --yum option yields an invitation to Peruvian food, which is
          the best in word. Consider lomo saltado, anticuchos, ceviche, chaufa
          (which is a Peruvian take on fried rice), amongst many other things.
          This nerd will make it happen!
          
          If vegetarian, try papa a la huancaina or choclo con queso. 
          
          If vegan, look into locro de zapallo (without cheese) or ceviche de mango
          which basically replaces the fish pieces with mango. Delicious.
     
          Depending on the time of day, --yum will throw in a nice Pisco-based drink. 
     
     <B>OTHER HOBBIES</B>
          The --play option is merely optimized for Metal Gear Solid and FIFA.
          Unfortunately, lack of motivated developers have made this module
          get stuck in the past. It is highly recommended to not pass a musical
          instrument as a value or run the risk of seg faults in the listener&apos;s
          ear drums.
     
          When passing pet names to the --play option, expect lots of smooching if 
          the pet is a cat; except is the cat throws a claw or hiss exception. 
          If a dog, then expect some patting on the head and maybe salsa dancing
          if the dog is big enough. If else, awe.
     
          The --ball option reliable when futbol is passed as a value. 
          A solid defensive midfielder in the old days, now functions as a full back. 
          Can put some quality weighted passes if enough space is available.
          
          If other sports are passed, expect mediocre and unpredictable results.
     
          Might cause high CPU utilization as this is the second most passionate
          and work intensitve activity after ethical hacking.
     
          Also likes cars. And some TV shows/anime.
