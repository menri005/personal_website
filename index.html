martin-enriquez - a multi-purpose nerd

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
martin-enriquez [--ball] [--hack] [--help]
                [--play] [--work] [--yum]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     martin-enriquez is a multi-purpose nerd with a passion for hacking,
     technology, soccer and good food. 

     Common uses include:

           o   defending hard in futbol
           o   hackin' all yer bases
           o   making lomo saltado and papa a la huancaina
           o   petting dogs and cats

<B>OPTIONS SUMMARY</B>
     --ball <u>futbol</u>
              like --play, but is optimized for futbol

     --hack <u>target</u>
              please use responsibly and at your own disk, I mean risk;
              more details below

     --help <u>someone</u>
              defaults to animals in need. If "me" is specified, then prints this menu

     --play <u>something</u>
              plays something. SOMETHING can, and should be, a sport, video or board 
              game; if SOMETHING: musical instrument, beware of noise-induced 
              hearing loss

     --work
              prints professional experience, may also `do` work if the time is right...

     --yum
              Peruvian food all day; will make drinks depending on locale and 
              datetime parse

<B>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</B>
     Over 10 years of experience in information technology and computer security;
     currently an offensive security tester and automation engineer at Mastercard

     Holds a bachelor's degree from Florida International University in Information 
     Technology, 2009. Currently working on a Master's degree in Cybersecurity 
     Management from Washington University in St. Louis.

     Is also CISSP certified. Might still hold some SANS certs unless the renewal 
     fee expired (but hey, the training is more important, right?)

     Passionate about almost every aspect of technology; was a system administrator
     and ticket-slayer in past lives. 

     Is compatible with Python, C++, Terraform, Packer and Ansible. These tools are 
     necessary to support infrastructure automation, which this nerdy app 
     thoroughly enjoys.

     The --work option will output templates or code using these tools. It can also 
     build tools to help parse large amounts of data that usually result from 
     a security assessment.

     Also note: at certain times you can pipe the output of the --work option 
     to a problematic server and it'll make its problems go away:

           $ martin-enriquez --work | nc host.example.com 22
           SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1
           Protocol mismatch...
           Just kidding!
           PROBLEMS SOLVED!

<B>ETHICAL HACKING</B>
     Figuring ways to defeat a security implementation is this nerd's raison
     d'etre.

     Always with good intentions in mind, and with the objective to help
     increase the security of the target under attack, the --hack option 
     is an evolution of the --debug option.

     There is no magic sauce or super secret skill behind hacking. 
     This nerd takes his time to break down and oversimplify a process,
     and then finds ways to abuse or misuse such process. 
     The definition of `process` is not limited to computer processes or
     network-connected computers but also human processes.

     A BIG admirer of the folks who are better than. Always gets
     excited to learn something new.

     An example of the thought process:

       $ martin-enriquez --hack 192.168.1.1 80

       [TRY]: Target is 192.168.1.1 at port 80 - attempting a simple TCP connection.
       [RESULT]: TCP conx is good. Host is live. 
       [TRY]: Making GET request for "/".
       [RESULT]: Parsed response headers. 
                 Host is running Apache HTTP server 2.2.
       [TRY]: Let's look for known vulnerable directories or apps...
       [CONCURRENT RESULTS]: Seems index page has a login form, and this is plaintext HTTP. Bruh...
                             Also found a common gateway interface (cgi_bin) - ShellShock!?

       <<<<< DECISION TIME >>>>> 

       How to proceed?

              [LOUD] : Could try exploiting ShellShock? 

              [STEALTH] : You are on the same network. Perhaps
                          drop wireless interface into monitor mode 
                          and watch for creds sent to this site...

       Choice: _

<B>WHEN HUNGER CALLS</B>
     The --yum option yields an invitation to Peruvian food, which is
     the best in word. Consider lomo saltado, anticuchos, ceviche, chaufa
     (which is a Peruvian take on fried rice), amongst many other things.
     This nerd will make it happen!
     
     If vegetarian, try papa a la huancaina or choclo con queso. 
     
     If vegan, look into locro de zapallo (without cheese) or ceviche de mango
     which basically replaces the fish pieces with mango. Delicious.

     Depending on the time of day, --yum will throw in a nice Pisco-based drink. 

<B>OTHER HOBBIES</B>
     The --play option is merely optimized for Metal Gear Solid and FIFA.
     Unfortunately, under-motivated developers have caused this functionality
     to get stuck in the past. It is highly recommended to not pass a musical
     instrument as a value or run the risk of seg faults in the listener&apos;s
     ear drums.

     When passing pet names to the --play option, expect lots of smooching if 
     the pet is a cat; except is the cat throws a claw or hiss exception. 
     If a dog, then expect some patting on the head and maybe salsa dancing
     if the dog is big enough. If else, awe.

     The --ball option is as reliable as a wood-burning stove when futbol
     is passed as a value. A solid defensive midfielder in the g(old)en days, 
     now functions as a full back. Can put some quality through balls if enough
     (memory) space is available.
     
     If other sports are passed, expect mediocre results.

     Might cause high CPU utilization as this is the second most passionate
     and work intensitve activity after ethical hacking.

     Also likes cars. And some TV shows/anime.
